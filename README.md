# Composite Secrets Controller

The Composite Secrets Controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you
to combine the data from multiple ConfigMap and Secret sources into a single
Secret.

## Description

Very often configuration files defined as Secrets reference the same secrets
over and over again. The Composite Secrets Controller allows you to define
a single secret that combines the data from multiple ConfigMap or Secret
sources. This can also be especially useful in situations when you are storing
Kubernetes manifests in a Git repo and use [SOPS Encrypted Secrets](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/)
and want to store non-sensitive parts of a secret in plain-text and reference
encrypted secrets.

The controller works by watching for `CompositeSecret` objects that get created
in the cluster, and generates a corresponding secret that combines multiple
secrets into one.

An example of a `CompositeSecret` looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: composite.shadowblip.com/v1alpha1
kind: CompositeSecret
metadata:
  name: compositesecret-sample
spec:
  replacements:
    REPLACEME:
      secretRef:
        name: compositesecret-sample-source
        namespace: default
        key: mykey
  template:
    stringData:
      my-thing: |
        Here we say REPLACEME
```

There are two main parts to a `CompositeSecret`: replacements and template.
The "replacements" section defines any number of keywords you want to replace
in the "template" section along with a `secretRef` or `configMapRef` that the
controller will use to replace the keyword in the template with.

The "template" section contains your plain-text secret data. Any keywords found
in the data you define here will get replaced with the values defined in the
"replacements" section.

**NOTE: Make sure your keywords don't show up anywhere in your secret data or they will also be replaced!**

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/composite-secrets-controller:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/composite-secrets-controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
